# Output section

The `[output]` table controls how transformed reads and reporting artefacts are written.

```toml
[output]
    prefix = "output"          # required.
    format = "Fastq", # (optional) output format, defaults to 'Fastq'
					  # Valid values are: Fastq, Fasta, BAM and None (for no sequence output)
    compression = "Gzip"        # Raw | Uncompressed | Gzip | Zstd | None (default: Raw)
    suffix = ".fq.gz"           # optional override; inferred from format when omitted
    compression_level = 6       # gzip: 0-9, zstd: 1-22, bam: 0-9 (BGZF); defaults are gzip=6, zstd=5
    ix_separator = "_"          # optional separator between prefix, infixes, and segments. Defaults to '_'

    report_json = false         # write prefix.json
    report_html = true          # write prefix.html

    output = ["read1", "read2"] # limit which segments become FastQ files
    interleave = false          # emit a single interleaved FastQ
    stdout = false              # stream to stdout instead of files

    output_hash_uncompressed = false
    output_hash_compressed = false
```

| Key                     | Default | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `prefix`                | `"output"` | Base name for all files produced by the run. |
| `format`                | `"Fastq"` | Output format. Valid values are: `Fastq`, `Fasta`, `Bam`, and `None` (for no sequence output). |
| `compression`           | `"Uncompressed"` | Compression format for read outputs. Valid values are: `Gzip`, `Zstd`, `Uncompressed` (alias: `"Raw"`). Must not be set for BAM |
| `suffix`                | derived from format | Override file extension when interop with other tooling demands a specific suffix. |
| `compression_level`     | gzip: 6, zstd: 5 | Fine-tune compression effort. Ignored for `Raw`/`None`. `Bam` maps directly to the BGZF level (0â€“9). |
| `report_json` / `report_html` | `false` | Toggle structured or interactive reports. |
| `output`                | all input segments | Restrict the subset of segments written to disk. Use an empty list to suppress FastQs while still running steps that depend on fragment data. |
| `interleave`            | `false` | Generate a single interleaved FastQ (`{prefix}_interleaved.fq*`).|
| `stdout`                | `false` | Write to stdout. Forces `format = "Raw"`. `Sets interleave=true` if more than one fragment is listed in `output`|
| `output_hash_uncompressed` / `output_hash_compressed` | `false` | Emit SHA-256 checksums. |
| `ix_separator`          | `"_"` | Separator inserted between `prefix`, any infix (demultiplex labels, inspect names, etc.), and segment names. |

Generated filenames join these components with `ix_separator` (default `_`), e.g. `{prefix}_{segment}{suffix}`. Interleaving replaces `segment` with `interleaved`; demultiplexing adds per-barcode infixes before the segment. Checksums use `.uncompressed.sha256` or `.compressed.sha256` suffixes.

Compression format and suffix are independent: overriding the suffix will not change the actual compression algorithm. 

> **BAM-specific notes**
> - `format = "Bam"` emits an *unaligned* BAM file using BGZF compression.
> - BAM may not contain spaces in read names. If a read has a space in it's Fastq name, it's truncated at the first space, and the remaining text is placed in the "CO" tag.
> - BAM output cannot be streamed to stdout and requires `output_hash_uncompressed = false` (compressed hashes continue to work).
> - Interleaved writes produce one paired BAM with appropriate SAM flags; per-segment outputs yield independent BAMs.

### Example output files.

#### As above
The above configuration produces:
- `output_read1.fq.gz` # .fq is the default suffix for raw, .fq.gz for gzip
- `output_read2.fq.gz`
- `output.html` # HTML report

#### If Interleaved was set
- `output_interleaved.fq.gz` 
- `output.html` # HTML report

### No sequence output

Set `format = "None"` or `output = []`  when you only need reports or tag quantification. 
A `prefix` is still required so report files have a stable name.

See also the [Report steps reference]({{< relref "docs/reference/report-steps/_index.md" >}}) for producing summaries, and the [Demultiplex documentation]({{< relref "docs/reference/Demultiplex.md" >}}) for how barcode outputs influence file naming.


## Named pipe outputs
Output files may be (preexisting) named pipes (FIFOs).

## Overwrite protection
If any output file already exists, mbf-fastq-processor will refuse to overwrite them.

Except when the incompletion marker (see below) is present.

### (In-)Completion marker

Every run writes `{prefix}.incompleted` in the output directory before any other file handles are opened. 
The file is deleted once processing finishes, so its presence later indicates an interrupted run. 

Because the marker predates other outputs, reruns detect its presence and permit overwriting prior artefacts without manual cleanup. 

If the process aborts for any reason, the marker stays behind.
