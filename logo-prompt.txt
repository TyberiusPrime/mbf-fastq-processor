DIFFUSION AI PROMPT FOR MBF-FASTQ-PROCESSOR LOGO
==================================================

A cute, friendly cartoon mutant crab character with four arms instead of two, designed as a tech mascot. The crab has a rounded, cheerful body in warm orange-red tones (#ff6b35). The crab is smiling and has large, expressive eyes with white highlights, giving it a friendly and approachable appearance.

The crab has FOUR distinct arms/claws extending from its body:
- Top left arm: tattooed with the chemical structure of Adenine (purine ring structure with nitrogen atoms, labeled 'A')
- Top right arm: tattooed with the chemical structure of Thymine (pyrimidine ring structure, labeled 'T')
- Bottom left arm: tattooed with the chemical structure of Guanine (purine ring structure, labeled 'G')
- Bottom right arm: tattooed with the chemical structure of Cytosine (pyrimidine ring structure, labeled 'C')

The tattoos should be simplified but recognizable chemical structures with hexagonal/pentagonal rings, showing the characteristic shapes of DNA nucleotides. Each tattoo is rendered in dark blue/black ink style on the crab's orange arms.

Optional details: tiny safety goggles, small lab coat elements, scientist aesthetic. Clean, modern vector art style. Suitable for a bioinformatics software logo. White or light blue background. The overall vibe should be: approachable, scientific, slightly quirky, professional yet playful.

Style: vector illustration, flat design, tech mascot, Rust programming language mascot inspired but mutated for bioinformatics.
