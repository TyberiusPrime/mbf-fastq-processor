SpotCheckReadPairing detected mismatched read names near read 1 (0-based, sampled every 1 reads). Expected prefix "Beta" from segment 0 name "Beta_1", but segment 1 provided prefix "Gamma" from name "Gamma_2". Fix your input, or disable this sampling check by setting options.spot_check_read_pairing = false or add a ValidateName step to choose a custom read_name_end_char.
