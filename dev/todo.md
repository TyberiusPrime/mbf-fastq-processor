# MBF FastQ Processor TODO

## Paper Ideas

### Demonstrate why the graph approach is necessary
https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/132 for an example


### FastP Reproducibility Issues

- **Objective**: Demonstrate that fastp produces non-reproducible results
- **Impact**: Shows a key advantage of our tool's deterministic approach
- **Implementation**: Create test cases that expose fastp's non-deterministic behavior

### PE to SE with Overlap Analysis Comparison

- **Objective**: Compare our overlap detection with fastp's implementation
- **Technical Details**:
  - fastp uses simple offset checking for overlap detection with parameters:
    - `overlap_len_require` (default 30)
    - `overlap_diff_limit` (default 5)
    - `overlap_diff_percent_limit` (default 20%)
  - Our approach: Modified Smith-Waterman algorithm from rust-bio
- **Expected Outcome**: Show we're both more accurate and faster
- **Requirements**: Need test datasets for evaluation

Also consider setting the incongruent bases to N,
see https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/346


### Insert Size Histogram Analysis

- **Objective**: Implement fastp-style overlapping reads processing statistics
- **Current Status**: We have the merging capability, just need the statistics collection
- **Value**: Provides users with library preparation quality metrics

#  once we have a paper, add a 'citation' command

## Code Changes

# Quality

    Figure out the quality story. Is it 'whatever's in the file?'
    is in decoded phred, if so which format is the default and how does the user specify the right one,
    (autodetect?)

[FASTQ quality encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding), 
[SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit), after some [discussion](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit/issues/18).
 

### Testing & Quality

- **Fix Non-Deterministic Tests**: `test_case_head_early_termination_multi_stage_head_report_middle` needs to be made deterministic

### New Transformations/Features

#### AnnotateBamWithTags

- **Purpose**: Add tag annotations to BAM files during processing
- **Dependencies**: Need to define tag format specification
- **Contra**: Might be better of as a separate tool reading tsv tables.

#### ConcatTags

- **Purpose**: Combine multiple tags into a single tag
- **Requirement**: Needs support for 'location-less' tags
- **Use Case**: Simplify tag management in complex pipelines
- **Advantage**: We could get rid of extractregions instead have multiple ExtractRegion
  I'm not convinced this is a good idea.

#### RewriteTag

- **Purpose**: Modify existing tags using regex patterns
- **Implementation**: Add regex-based tag transformation capability
- **Use Case**: Standardize tag formats or extract information from existing tags

#### StoreTagInSequence Optimization

- **Problem**: Currently discards all tag locations when growing/shrinking sequences
- **Solution**: Preserve relevant tag locations during sequence modifications
- **Benefit**: Better tag location tracking throughout pipeline

### Inspec### Architecture Improvements

#### Filter Inversion Consistency

- **Problem**: Inconsistent inversion support across filters
  - Some filters can invert (e.g., `FilterOtherFile`)
  - Others are inverses of each other (e.g., `FilterMinLen`, `FilterMaxLen`)
- **Solution**: Add consistent `invert` flag to all filters
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more intuitive filter configuration

#### Multi-File Input Support

- **Current Limitation**: Limited to read1/read2/index1/index2 structure
- **Goal**: Support arbitrary number of input files
- **Scope**: Large refactoring task
- **Alternative**: At minimum support read1, (read2), index1, no index2 with `keep_index`

#### ExtractLength Target Specification

- **Question**: Should `ExtractLength` support `TargetPlusAll` parameter?
- **Impact**: Would allow more flexible length extraction patterns

### Performance & Output

#### Compression Investigation

- **Issue**: Slow decompression performance on ERR13885883
  - Current: ~44.7s (43.07s without output)
  - Recompressed gz: 44.7s (42.39s)
  - zstd: 43.53s (24s)
- **Investigation**: Compare with fastp performance
- **Potential Solution**: Explore `gzp` crate for parallel Gzip writing

#### Parallel Decompression

- **Research**: Investigate `gzp` crate for parallel Gzip operations
- **Limitation**: Gzip format may not be amenable to parallel reading
- **Alternative**: Focus on parallel writing optimizations

### Quality Control & Reporting

#### Advanced Quality Metrics

- **Reads with expected error rate < 1%** (approximately Q20 average)
- **Reads with expected error rate < 0.1%** (approximately Q30 average)
- **Base quality score histograms** (FastQC-style but improved visualization)
- **Sequence length distribution histograms**

#### Overrepresented Sequence Detection

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Skip x reads for baseline
  2. Count 12-mers (2^24 possibilities) for next n reads
  3. For following nÃ—x reads, calculate max occurrence using k-mer table
  4. Apply enrichment threshold filtering
  5. Calculate enrichment based on actual counts
  6. Remove sequences that are prefixes of others
- **Output**: Report overrepresented sequences with enrichment statistics
- **Problems**: Difficult to validate
- **Other ideas**: How does FASTQC do it?

#### Duplication Analysis

- **Feature**: Duplication distribution reporting (frequency of duplicates)
- **Reference**: Compare with fastp's approach (samples ~1 in 20 reads up to 10k)

## Miscellaneous

### Research & Benchmarking

- **Benchmark Suite**: Comprehensive comparison against fastp, fasterq, seqstats
- **Quality Encoding Support**: Add support for solexa, illumina-1.3+, illumina-1.5+, illumina-1.8+ encodings
  (I don't even know where the differences are)

### Documentation & Standards

- **Adapter Sequence Research**:
  - Study cutadapt algorithms and adapter types
  - Reference Illumina adapter sequences document
  - Understand adapter-based trimming mechanisms

### Advanced Features (Lower Priority)

- **Order Shuffling**: Implement read order randomization (long range is difficult to implement)
- **True Duplicate Collapse**: Remove identical sequences (=same name. dubious utility)
- **High K-mer Read Removal**: Multi-pass normalization (reference: fasten_normalize)
- **Progress Display**: Modify Progress to avoid new line each iteration

### External Tool Integration

- **SeqKit Comparison**: Review seqkit usage patterns for feature ideas
- **SeqStats Analysis**: Study seqstats for additional statistics to implement
- **Niffler Integration**: Explore niffler for compression writer improvements

### Separator Configuration

- **Question**: Do we need separators on `ExtractRegions`, or is store-in-comment sufficient?
- **Related**: Should `ExtractAnchor` be renamed to `ExtractRelativeToTag`?

### Read Overlap Detection (BD Rhapsody Style)

- **Algorithm**: Modified Knuth-Morris-Pratt substring search
- **Parameters**:
  - Maximum mismatch rate: 9% (configurable)
  - Minimum overlap length: 25 bases
- **Process**:
  1. Scan read1 right-to-left on reverse complement of read2
  2. Find closest offset with lowest mismatches below threshold
  3. Split merged read according to R1 minimum length + bead capture sequence length
- **Benefit**: Prevent downstream mis-alignment and mis-assembly
- **Metrics**: Calculate overlap detection percentage for troubleshooting

I'm unwilling to hook it up for auto-trim, but
it might be useful as a separate mode, like overrepresentation detection? 

# verify input files != output_files (hard to do, but hey...)

# we should introduce a marker that signals even after the fact that processing was finished (even if no reports are requested). Rename the output files or such..

# do we have a test case when segment files are of unequal length...?

# implement quality filtering by maximum expected error as outlined here: https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/exp_errs.html.

This quality filtering technique has shown to be superior to filtering techniques like mean Q-score.

(especially with regards to the comments)

# should we have a sample function that picks exactly N reads?
- what happens if there are not enough reads.
- how does it differ from head, or a head/tail combo, 
- how does it actually decide which reads to keep? Given each read 
an equal probability is difficult when you don't know how many reads will be there
And making an approximate but almost exact estimator for the number of reads
we are going to see is too much work for this.
