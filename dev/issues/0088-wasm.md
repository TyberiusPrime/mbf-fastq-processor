# WASM


To absolutly minimize the barrier of entry,
we should add a WASM build.

Problem here is that WASM doesn't do threads.

So we need to fall back to some kind of asyncio.

AsyncIO would be nice to benchmark anyway - not that
I expect it to outperform the current threading
(that needs benchmarking) ,
but it might offer a better 'how many cores do we use' control.
