# Method to convert a numeric tag (counts) to a rate per bp?

I guess we could also just add it to the extracts?
what's hit anyway... GC, n_count, qualified_bases...

Also, what about 'non-n-count'... Suddenly you've got a mini-calculation language at hand.

Or at least you need to be able to specify a denominator 'tag'.
