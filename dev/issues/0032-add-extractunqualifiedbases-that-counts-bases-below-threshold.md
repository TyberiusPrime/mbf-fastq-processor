# add ExtractUnqualifiedBases that counts bases below threshold

GitHub Issue: [https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/128](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/128)
There is some issue here wether ExtractQualifiedBases now counts above or below threshold,
and whether we even need the inverse?
