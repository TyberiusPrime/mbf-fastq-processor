# Insert Size Histogram Analysis

- **Objective**: Implement fastp-style overlapping reads processing statistics
- **Current Status**: We have the merging capability, just need the statistics collection
- **Value**: Provides users with library preparation quality metrics

Guess we could do an 'insert size' extraction step (related to MergeReads, then the histogram works)
