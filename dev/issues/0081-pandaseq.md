Read overlapping is a suprisingly diverse field.

It lists some  more 'read overlap alignment' methods.



    COPE (Connecting Overlapped Pair-End reads) – Algorithm similar to FLASH
    FastqJoin in ea-utils – Algorithm included in PANDAseq
    FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) – Algorithm included in PANDAseq
    PEAR (Paired-End AssembleR) – Algorithm included in PANDAseq
    stitch
    XORRO (Rapid Pair-end Read Overlapper)
    leeHom
