# ConcatTags

- **Purpose**: Combine multiple tags into a single tag
- **Requirement**: Needs support for 'location-less' tags
- **Use Case**: Simplify tag management in complex pipelines
- **Advantage**: We could get rid of extractregions instead have multiple ExtractRegion
  I'm not convinced this is a good idea.
