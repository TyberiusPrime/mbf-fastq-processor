# investigate SDUST

 [SDUST algorithm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16796549/), perhaps by linking in @lh3's [standalone C implementation](https://github.com/lh3/sdust)?

(also) A low complexity filter using methods such as Entropy or Dust. The current filter does not work well on tandem repeats and similar type of low complexity sequences.
