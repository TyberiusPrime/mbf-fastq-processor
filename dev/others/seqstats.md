## seqstats
    c, last update 7 years ago (very mature software, I suppose)
    total n, total seq, avng len, median len, n50, min len, max len
    very fast: 20.7s for gz, 11s for uncompressed, no zstd
        How is it decompressing the file so fast?
        gzip itself takes 29.5 seconds for me!.
        Pigz does it in 12.8s, so you *can* parallel decompress gzip..
        crabz doesn't manage the same trick cpu load (seems to stay single core), but does decompress in 11.2s/
        I think it's just choosing a different zlib? hm...
