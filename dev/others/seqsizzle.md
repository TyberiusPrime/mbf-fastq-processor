 A pager for viewing FASTQ and FASTA files with fuzzy matching, allowing different adaptors to be colored differently. 




It does have some nice colorization, even though it's essentially a grep with hamming distanec..


Has an 'enrich' command to find enriched kmers. 
Worth checking out.

arithmetic progression between k-values...,
checks all kmers from 8..12, with k_step == 2 by default.
Keeps the 200 top kmers per value, and basically sorts them by log(observed/expected).

Expected seems to be 'dumb', not background modelling.

Yeah that's not really helping finding longer overrepresented sequences.
