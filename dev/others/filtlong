A kmer based tool that can be used to reduce nanopore runs
to 'just the good' reads.

trivial feature:
 - min -length

interesting features
- throw out by length percentily.
- throw out by length until x bp remain.
- read splitting at regions that don't match a kmer in the reference for 500 bp...
- trim bases at start/end that do not match a kmer in the reference

I think you could do both by running mbf-fastq-processor twice,
once for the read length distribution, once for the filtering.
There's also some phred quality based filtering?

The kmer based stuff the author is warning about, it's not working well


Todo: Turn into a how to, at least for teh 'no reference' case.?
