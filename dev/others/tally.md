"Tally is a program for deduplicating sequence fragments."

Seems to use compressed sequences an d'compact memory allocation techniques'

Comes with 'reaper', 'a program for demultiplexing, trimming and filtering short read sequencing data.' 


Optionally keeps the best quality read. That's nice...

It has read-head-stripping options..

Tag count format seems to be essentialy 
Fastq, with read names = read-name (some whitespace) repetition count.
