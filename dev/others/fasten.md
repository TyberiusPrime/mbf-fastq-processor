used to be called (ross, investigate https://crates.io/crates/ross )Ã¤

Very basic metrics (total bases, numReads, avgReadLength, avgQuality)
 (do not avg those log scores...)

some cleaning.

No compression, interleaved input / output.

Kmer counting.

Sampling.

Low quality filtering & trimming (ends only).

Collapse (remove true aduplicates)

'random mutation'

'remove some reads from high kmer depths'.

low quality base to N.

shuffleing - actually, taht's r1/r2 interleaving, no shuffleing involved.

Sort by GC content for 'better compression'.
