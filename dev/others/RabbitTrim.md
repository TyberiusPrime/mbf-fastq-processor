Very fast (or so it claims),
need to benchmark against this!


Suppotrs two modes:
- trimmomatic features
    (guess you need to know what trimmomatic does).
-ktrim
    (guess you need to know what ktrim does).

But overall, it's another 'limited trick no composition'-tool.


The github top commit (10 months old) won't compile, 
undeclared variable..

going back a few months does.
