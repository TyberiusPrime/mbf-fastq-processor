FASTX parsing kmer methods

library, not command line.
Python API available.

reads compressed data, parses fasta/fastq, 
can do 'canonical sequence' (lexigraphically smaller of seq and it's revcomp)

base-cleanup functions.

Kmer iterating (possibly 'canonical'), nothing else.


Might be fast about it though.
