# Rust Code Coverage Implementation Plan

## Overview
Establish a comprehensive code coverage measurement system for the mbf_fastq_processor project that integrates with our existing test suite and provides actionable insights for improving test coverage.

## Goals
- Measure code coverage across all test types (unit, integration, test cases)
- Generate coverage reports in multiple formats (terminal, HTML, CI-friendly)
- Integrate coverage measurement into development workflow
- Identify untested code paths and critical gaps

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Coverage Tool Selection and Setup
- Evaluate coverage tools: `cargo-tarpaulin`, `grcov`, or `cargo-llvm-cov`
- Add chosen tool as development dependency or external tool
- Configure coverage collection settings

### 2. Coverage Integration with Existing Tests
- Ensure coverage captures:
  - Unit and integration tests (`cargo test`)
- Configure to run against both debug and release builds if needed

### 3. Coverage Reporting
- Generate HTML reports for detailed line-by-line analysis
- Create terminal summary reports for quick feedback

### 4. Development Workflow Integration
- Add coverage commands to CLAUDE.md for easy reference
- Create scripts in `dev/` directory for coverage collection
- Document coverage targets and expectations
