# Plan for issue 0054

1. Review existing expected error calculation flow (implementation, config, docs, tests) to understand inputs/outputs.
2. Implement mandatory `aggregate` argument with `sum`/`max` options in code and configuration, updating documentation accordingly.
3. Extend templates and test cases to exercise both aggregation modes and confirm behavior.
