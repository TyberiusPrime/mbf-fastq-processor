# Task
Include `src/template.toml` as an explicit reference for LLM-assisted workflows in the documentation and README.

## Plan
1. Review existing README and documentation pages that discuss configuration templates.
2. Update the README with a pointer to `src/template.toml` so LLMs and users can ground instructions on the canonical template.
3. Update the TOML reference documentation (or equivalent) to cross-link the template file and clarify how to use it during documentation or LLM interactions.

## Notes
- Keep references stable by preferring workspace-relative links.
- Preserve existing docs structure and front matter.
