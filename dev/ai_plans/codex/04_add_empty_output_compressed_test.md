## Context
- Current integration coverage ensures compressed outputs match expected content but may not exercise the edge case where no records survive filtering.
- We need a regression test showing that even when the logical output is empty, the CLI still writes gzip-compressed files rather than truncating to plain text.
- Fixtures and harnesses for end-to-end tests live under `test_cases/` and `tests/`, with updates orchestrated through `dev/update_tests.py`.

## Numbered Implementation Plan
1. **Inspect existing compression tests**
   - Grep for scenarios referencing empty outputs or gzip validation to understand current assertions and reuse helper utilities.

2. **Author deterministic empty-output fixture**
   - Create input FASTQs and config (under `test_cases/`) that drive the pipeline to drop every read while still producing the expected output slots.
   - Record the expected `.fq.gz` artifacts, ensuring they contain valid gzip headers despite zero reads.

3. **Regenerate integration harness metadata**
   - Run `python3 dev/update_tests.py` to capture the new fixture manifest and synchronize path listings in `tests/integration_tests.rs`.

4. **Implement test assertions**
   - Extend the relevant integration test to reference the new fixture and assert both file existence and gzip magic bytes (e.g., `0x1f 0x8b`) or size expectations.

5. **Validate locally**
   - Execute `cargo test -- --ignored` (if the suite marks fixture tests ignored) to confirm the new scenario passes and the CLI preserves compression semantics.

6. **Document the edge case**
   - Update any developer docs or troubleshooting guides that mention output compression to note the guaranteed gzip format even for empty results.
