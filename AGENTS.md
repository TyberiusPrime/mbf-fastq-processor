# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

The Rust workspace lives under `src/`. `src/main.rs` hosts the CLI entry point and delegates to the library in `src/lib.rs`, while specialized pipelines sit in modules like `src/transformations.rs`, `src/demultiplex.rs`, and the configs under `src/config/`.  Integration assets reside in `test_cases/` (fixture FASTQs, expected outputs) and are orchestrated by harnesses under `tests/`. Developer utilities and scripts live in `dev/`, documentation drafts in `docs/`, and benchmark harnesses in `benchmarks/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Cargo for day-to-day work: `cargo build` for debug builds, `cargo build --release` for optimized artifacts, and `cargo run -- <config.toml>` to exercise the CLI locally. `cargo check` gives a fast type check, while `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D clippy::pedantic` enforces lint compliance. When fixtures change, run `dev/update_tests.py` before executing `cargo test` to regenerate derived files; add `-- --ignored` to cover long-running cases. Coverage reports come from `python3 dev/coverage.py --summary` or `--html`. A reproducible toolchain is available through `nix develop`. Run cargo through nix if you receive 'unknown command: cargo' errors.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow rustfmt defaults (`cargo fmt`). Prefer 4-space indentation, snake_case for modules/functions, CamelCase for types, and descriptive test names like `test_valid_demultiplex_template`. Keep public APIs documented with `///` doc comments and favor explicit error handling via `anyhow::Result`. Run `clippy -D clippy: pedantic` before submitting.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests live alongside features: unit tests in each module, integration suites in `tests/`, and golden files in `test_cases/`. Every new fixture must include expected outputs and a matching entry in `tests/integration_tests.rs` (generated via `dev/update_tests.py'`. Maintain â‰¥85% line coverage by extending scenarios rather than disabling checks. 

Do not bother to clean up 'actual' folders, they're ig .gitignore anyway.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Write concise, sentence-style commit subjects (e.g., `Verify barcodes are disjoint`) and keep related changes together. PRs should describe the motivation, outline validation steps (`cargo test`, coverage runs), and link issues or research notes. Attach screenshots or sample command outputs when behavior changes, and request review when clippy and tests are clean.
Use jujutsu (jj) for version control, following its branching and merging conventions.

## AI Planning Notes

Store Codex agent plans in `dev/ai_plans/codex/<next-number>-short-description.md` alongside the corresponding numbered history.
